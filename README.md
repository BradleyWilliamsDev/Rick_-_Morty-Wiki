# Rick and Morty Wiki:
This is a project that I made that uses a public API that keeps track of the characters in Rick and Morty it is a small simple project I made in order to learn how to use API's and use the data that API's provide in order to create and populate this wiki.

# How To Setup:
1. Download the files in the repository.
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. CD to the file path
4. Run npm i to install all necessary dependancies
5. Run the command 'nodemon index.js' in the terminal
6. You should see a popup that reads that the server is running on port 3000
7. Open your browser
8. Type localhost:3000 into the url and hit enter
9. You are now able to view the website
